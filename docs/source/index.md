# Sphinx-multitoc-numbering

**An extension for continuous numbering of toctree elements across multiple toctrees**.

This package contains a [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) extension to continuously number sections across multiple toctrees present in the same document. Also quite useful in [jupyter-book](https://jupyterbook.org/) projects for continuous numbering of chapters across different parts.

```{warning}
sphinx-multitoc-numbering is in an active development stage and may change rapidly.

## Demo

(sphinx-example)=
#### Sphinx example

For the following rst code:

```python
Part1

..  toctree::
    :numbered:

    Chap1
    Chap2

Part2

..  toctree::
    :numbered:

    Chap3
```
The resultant html numbering will look something like:


```
Part1

    1. Chap1 Title
    2. Chap2 Title

Part2

    3. Chap3 Title
```

(jb-example)=
#### Jupyter-book example

For the following code in `_toc.yml`:

```yaml
- file: intro
  numbered: true

- part: part1
  chapters:
  - file: part1/chapter1
  - file: part1/chapter2

- part: part2
  chapters:
  - file: part2/chapter1
```

The resultant html numbering will look something like:


```
Intro

PART1

1. part1/chapter1 title
2. part1/chapter2 title

PART2

3. part2/chapter1 title
```
